# Data-Mining-and-Information-Retrieval

    Stage 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
In this stage, we collected a diverse set of text documents to serve as our corpus. These documents included articles, web pages, and other textual content. We ensured that the documents were in a format that could be easily parsed and indexed. Following data collection, we performed preprocessing tasks to prepare the data for indexing. This involved tokenization, which split documents into individual words or tokens, lowercase conversion to ensure case insensitivity, and stopword removal to eliminate common words that do not contribute significantly to the meaning of the document. Additionally, we applied stemming or lemmatization techniques to reduce words to their base or root form, enhancing the efficiency of our search engine.

    Stage 2: Indexing
In the indexing stage, we built an inverted index, a crucial data structure for efficient retrieval of relevant documents. This involved mapping each unique word to the documents containing that word and maintaining a list of document IDs along with the frequency of occurrence for each term. By constructing this inverted index, we optimized the search process, enabling rapid retrieval of documents containing specific terms.

    Stage 3: Query Processing
Query processing is a fundamental component of our search engine implementation. In this stage, we implemented parsing of user queries and applied the same preprocessing steps (tokenization, lowercase conversion, etc.) as used during indexing. Leveraging the inverted index, we identified relevant documents by matching query terms to indexed terms and retrieved documents containing all query terms. Subsequently, we ranked the retrieved documents using the TF-IDF algorithm, ensuring that the most relevant documents were presented to the user.

    Stage 4: Query Expansion
To enhance the search experience, we incorporated query expansion techniques in our search engine. By analyzing top-ranked documents for initial queries, we applied relevance feedback to refine subsequent search results. Additionally, we integrated synonyms or related terms using pre-built mappings or embeddings ELMo, expanding the scope of search queries and improving retrieval accuracy.

    Stage 5: User Interface
Developing a user-friendly interface was crucial for facilitating user interaction with our search engine. We designed a basic yet intuitive interface that accepts user queries and displays relevant search results. The interface provides users with a seamless experience, enabling them to quickly access the information they seek.



    Stage 6: Evaluation
Evaluation is essential for assessing the performance of our search engine. We rigorously tested it with various queries to evaluate retrieval accuracy and speed. Through thorough evaluation, we ensured that our search engine meets the desired standards of efficiency and effectiveness, providing users with reliable and relevant search results.
